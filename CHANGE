    - adc function had a little error. It was first calculating the carry
      and then was adding it to REGISTER A. We should first do the addition
      and then calculate the CARRY.
    - Well, adc was causing the problem to the sprites. We need transperacy but
      they are ok!

bobonis
    - more work on spites, Tetris is ok, Asteroids sucks
    - Now pressing "p" will pause the execution for 1 second

bobonis
    - Fixed rom booting after BIOS
        (Problem was bios overwrote memory address 0x00-0x100)
    - New switchable debug variable in cpu.c
    - Implemented all extended opcodes for BIT OPERATIONS

bobonis
    - Check LCDC register to draw background and / or sprites
    - Taso check add function for 0x86 opcode. Changed HALFCARRY and ZERO
    - Bios locks at checksum (After changed 0x86 ZERO no more locks)
    - [ERROR] Opcode 0x3a not implemented

Bobonis
    - Many changes from both bakg and alam Finally some progress!

bobonis
    - Hardcoded FF00 at DF. It's at writememory. We should implement INPUT

bobonis
    - Global use of readMemory and writeMemory in cpu.c

bobonis
    - Bios boot is now switchable via USINGBIOS flag in memory.h

bobonis
    - Finally it clears correctly the screen, Drawing seems ok now!
    - Changed framebuffer coordinates its [height][width][colour] now

alam
   - stackPop16 bugb
   - more Opcodes
   
alam
    - RET bug
    - stackPop16 possible bug
    - some Opcodes
    
bobonis
    - new file display.c and its header
    - create SDL opengl window reading from framebuffer
    - Window now closes correctly !!

alam
    - Fixed opcode 0xFA
    - Implemented "family" LD r1,r2

bobonis
    - Comment out SDL until there is some progress done
    - Fixed opcode 0xFE

bobonis
    - Finished work on backround
    - Started working on SDL window 

alam
    - Enrich DEBUG printout with the name of the opcode
    - Started working on opcodes

bobonis
    - Most of work done for GPU timers and registers.

bobonis
    - Started working on GPU

bobonis
    - Two new functions in memory.c to read from memory. readMemory8 and readMemory16
    - Fixed jumps to handle signed chars (needs testing)
    - I've tested running of Tetris so far in comparison with cinoop. 100% match!!! Well Done!
    

bobonis
    - Updated flag handling so when manual say that a register is set if condition
      then I reset it if condition is not met

bobonis
    - Implemented stack with pushStack and popStack
    - Implemented interrupts
    - Updated cpu.c and cpu.h structure

bobonis
    - Added two new functions in memory: readMemory and writeMemory
    - Added two new functions in memory: setBit and testBit
    - Made some corrections to if syntax shame shame shame
    - Implement timer functions
    - test git
    
bobonis
    - changed debug output in cpu.c
    - moved bioslogo declaration to rom.c to get rid of warning
    - included rom.h in main.c declarations to get rid of warning
    - added dummy functions for gpu timers input and interrups
    - moved header files under include folder
